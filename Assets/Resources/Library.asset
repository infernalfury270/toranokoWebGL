    description: '"I promise, I''ll never let you go." The tides had turned for the
      Takasu family after the delivery of Taiga''s triplets had gone awry, leaving

      mother would glare over his shoulder as her threat to take Taiga away loomed
      over the couple. Wanting to avoid that outcome at all costs, Ryuuji would do
      everything he can to keep Taiga away from any more harm by any means necessary,
      even when Taiga herself would try to go against them.\n\nA look at the future
      of the Takasu family after the events of Toradora! and the precursor to the
      spinoff sequel, Toranoko!'
