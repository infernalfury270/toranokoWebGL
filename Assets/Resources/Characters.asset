    characterList:
    - name: Takasu Ryuuji
      description: A stay-at-home dad who always takes great care of his family.
        He goes to great lengths to ensure that his children are well-fed and his
        wife comes back from work to a clean home. While the people around him fear
        the glare from his sanpaku eyes, his children seek comfort in his gentle
        gaze. Even though his daughters struggle at school and his wife gets stressed
        from her role as a mother, he continues to work to his strengths, ensuring
        his meals put bright smiles on their faces.

    - name: Takasu Taiga
      description: The breadwinner and matriarch of the family. With her strong fighting
        spirit and charisma, she became a feisty and wealthy salarywoman to support
        her family of six, but being a mother has been an absolute nightmare. The
        fear of where her daughters will be in the future is constantly looming over
        her, and she feels totally powerless over them, especially with how much
        bigger they were compared to her. Well, as long as everyone comes home at
        the end of the day, they'll be fine, right?

    - name: Takasu Haruko
      description: The first and the oldest of the Takasu sisters... by about six
        minutes. Takasu Haruko is the smartest of the triplets. Well, she isn't that
        smart, since she's one of the lower performing students of the class. But
        she's always trying to help her sisters just barely pass their exams. She's
        also formed a weird antagonistic relationship with her English teacher, since
        she gets bugged by her the most. It's hard to blame her when she's just doing
        everything she can to fit in.

    - name: Takasu Mitsuko
      description: Compared to her sisters, she's a lot more passive and mellow.
        While she spends most of her time in her own world, she always tries to be
        kind wherever she can. She usually finds herself getting between her sisters,
        while her sisters are always trying to protect her from any threats that
        come her way. She really, really loves books, so much so that it disrupts
        her performance in class. While she hides from the scary world outside her
        books, her wish to share this love of books remains.

    - name: Takasu Katsuko
      description: All brawn, no brains. That's what she is. There isn't a better
        feeling than being stronger than everyone else. But status isn't the reason
        she became so strong. Her strength helps her knock any obstacles out of her
        sisters' way. She's the most hostile of the sisters, so nobody dares to mess
        with her, besides a few outliers. She isn't afraid to get violent as long
        as it protects the secure triangle the sisters have formed. But at worst,
        you'll get put six feet under. The only one that can take her on is Haruko,
        who is always trying to get her study.

    - name: Takasu Yuuchi
      description: The youngest in the family and an avid gamer. He's in a weird
        position when it comes to his family. His sisters never stopped treating
        him like a kid. Especially Katsuko, who's always picking on him. He doesn't
        find his father very remarkable, and his mother is extremely doting towards
        him. Now in his second year of junior high, he goes about his life without
        a care in the world, only needing his video games and gamer friends to keep
        him company, or so he believes.

        that his mother and father had worked so hard to build. He studies long hours
        to maintain his good grades with a part-time job on the side to alleviate
        his single mother''s financial burdens. He''s not someone that likes to spend
        time messing around, nor does he want anyone else''s pity, no matter how
        much sleep he loses. He needs to stay focused to keep anything from falling
        apart. Unfortunately, after getting thrown into a pair project assigned by
        Yuri-sensei, one girl would become his biggest distraction: Takasu Haruko.'

    - name: Ninomae Arisa
      description: She's always trying to stay true to her own values no matter what,
        even if it makes herself look a little too serious sometimes. Lightening
        up isn't easy for her, but as Takasu Mitsuko's best friend, she tries to
        become someone more fun to be around. At the same time, she helps Mitsuko
        keep her head out of the clouds.

    - name: Koigakubo Tarou
      description: His struggle to speak makes him a really quiet boy. Most of his
        responses come in the form of a shake or a nod, and any word that leaves
        his mouth is barely audible. He even has a hard time talking to his own mother.
        Even though his grades are alright, his lack of sociability leaves more to
        be desired. That's why he chose to join the student council in hopes of becoming
        more proactive. His days there wouldn't be easy, but through all his troubles,
        he'd start to grow closer to Takano Saki, his classmate who would join the
        council alongside him.

        The harmony of the classroom amongst all the students in her class is of
        utmost importance, so she always delivers a big smile to everyone she talks
        to. She's destined for student council president!
